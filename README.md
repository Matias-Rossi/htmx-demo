# htmx-demo

HTMX playground featuring Thymeleaf &amp; Spring Boot based on a reservation-management application for a small hotel.
Only basic functionality is applied as the idea of this project is to try and learn how to use Thymeleaf and HTMX. 

- SOLID principles were somewhat applied, without making extensive focus on them
- No persistence implemented, as it would make this playground unnecessarily more complex 
- Bootstrap was used for basic styling, while also trying to keep that classic CRUDy, backend developer made look
